Hey there! I'm a Junior Developer who's totally into programming, especially Python. I'm all about writing neat and efficient code, and I know my way around tools like pip.

When it comes to web stuff, I've got some mad skills with Django. I love taking on new coding challenges and I'm always up for learning something new.
