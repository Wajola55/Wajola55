  🌟 Hi, I'm Wioletta Koczor - a developer with a strong foundation in Python and a passion for frontend and web development. My journey began with Python, but I soon discovered that frontend and web development offered a world of creativity that I couldn't resist. Now, I'm dedicated to creating websites using various technologies like React, HTML, CSS, and WordPress. I believe in the power of coding to bring ideas to life, and I'm excited to be a part of this amazing tech community, ready to contribute, learn, and grow together! 🛠️🎨
